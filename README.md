This program will search a set of pdb files to find Arg's that H-bond to a guanine in a pyrimidine-guanine pair and also are within a cutoff distance of the C5 atom of the pyrimidine ring. Will also print out statistics for bond distances that are indicative of a loss of pyrimidine-guanine base stacking. This work is described fully in the following publication: Jason S Lamoureux  1 , Jason T Maynes, J N Mark Glover. Recognition of 5'-YpG-3' sequences by coupled stacking/hydrogen bonding interactions with amino acid residues. J Mol Biol. 2004 Jan 9;335(2):399-408.  doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2003.10.071.
